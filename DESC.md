# Description of the project for FlightSim.to

The purpose of this project is to establish a decent set of checklist items in the game menu for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. I'm super grateful for the work ariebaba has done by creating free add-on of the OV-10 Bronco. This checklist was taken from a POH I found for OV-10D.

## Features

- Some checklist items (6 of 18).
- Some visual assistance (eye icon) functionality.
- Aircraft guide for OV-10 Bronco (PDF). The guide has all the checklist items and additional development notes. It also displays camera definitions.

## Checklist

- Pre-flight checklist
- Cockpit check
- Before start
- Unfeathered (If required)
- Starting engines
- Aborted/Hung start

## To be done

There are numerous things to do, this release is to see if there is any interest from the community. It's a good amount of work to get the checklist fully functional.

## Resources

This project is a gift to the community. I learned a lot about the checklist XML system. It was difficult to find the answers and I don't want to make it difficult for you. This project is available at https://github.com/fergatron/ov10-bronco-checklist for anyone to use and improve upon. There's a good amount of notes from what I've learned.
